<h2>Modifying filesystem</h2>

Mount System partition:
<p class="cli">mount_apfs /dev/disk0s1s3 /mnt1</p>

And modify fstab using nano:
<p class="cli">cp -a /etc/fstab /mnt1/etc/fstab</p>
<p class="cli">nano /mnt1/etc/fstab</p>
<img class="align" src="images/Image7.png"></br>
    Change disk0s1s1 to disk0s1s3 and disk0s1s2 to disk0s1s4. (or the new system and data partitions disks based on the device.)</br>
    Press CTRL-O to save and CTRL-X to exit.
    
    <p>Now we have to add SEP to the second system:</br>
    <p class="cli">cp -a /usr/standalone/firmware/sep* /mnt1/usr/standalone/firmware/</p>
    <p>Also add the baseband firmware:</br>
    <p class="cli">cp -av /usr/local /mnt1/usr/local</p>
    <p>The baseband is located inside of /usr/local, and the firmware names vary across devices. We can just copy it since the /usr/local path does not exist on the new system.<p>
    
	<h3>Fixing Baseband and Touch ID</h3>
	<p  class="cli">cp -av /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.factorydata/ /mnt1/System/Library/Caches/</p>
	<p>Now the secondary OS can be activated properly with working service!</p>
    <h3>Modifying data partition</h3>
    <p>Now we have to move /private/var to new Data partition:
    <p class="cli">mount_apfs /dev/disk0s1s4 /mnt2</p>
    <p class="cli">mv -v /mnt1/private/var/* /mnt2</p>
	<p>The system requires this folder to be present on newer devices which have a baseband data paritition:</p>
	<p class="cli">mkdir /mnt2/wireless/baseband_data</p>
	
	<h3><b>Notes for haptic devices</b></h3>

	<p>With the introduction of the iPhone 6s, Apple began to utilize a haptic feedback engine in their devices, mainly for 3D Touch. The iPhone 7(+) and 8(+) also shipped with  
	capacitive home buttons which do not physically click, but instead use the haptic engine to simulate a click.</p>
	<p>In order to fix haptics on the second operating system, we must copy FUD data restored to the main install.</p>
	<p>copy FUD data to new system:</p>
	<p class="cli">cp -av /usr/standalone/firmware/FUD /mnt1/usr/standalone/firmware</p>

	<p>In order for the secondary system to see this data as valid, it is also required to copy the main OS apticket (as the FUD images are signed with those)</p>

	<p class="cli">cp -av /System/Library/Caches/apticket.der /mnt1/System/Library/Caches</p>

	<p>Now 3D touch feedback and home buttons will work as intended!</p></br>
